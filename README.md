# Galactus Documentation
This is intended as a publicly available documentation for The Beyond's Galactus Discord Bot. 
The bot has been developed in Python using the Nextcord module which is a fork of the original discord.py module. 

This documentation has been divided into three section for now and is very likely to be changed in the future to make it look nicer!

* The Prefixes for Galactus bot are \$, g\!, and G\!. For my examples I will always use \$, but it is interchangable with the others if you wish. 

### Key Notes
* Anything listed in \<> is a required argument for the commands and the command will not work without it, __DO NOT INCLUDE THE \<> IN THE COMMAND__.
* Anything listed in \[] is an optional argument for the commands and allows the command to use what you add, __DO NOT INCLUDE THE \[] IN THE COMMAND__.
